# About R7.DnnLocalization

*R7.DnnLocalization* project goal is to provide complete *Russian* localization
of [DNN Plaftorm](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/) static resource files (the UI messages).

Currently localization is based on 7.1.2 version of *DNN Platform*, but it could be
used with more recent versions. Note that then I finally switch to the new version,
all 7.1.2-related stuff will remain in the separate Git branch.

Feel free to extend the project to provide localization for other cultures!
Though I have no plans to translate *DNN* to any other language than *Russian*,
all helper scripts are customizable.

## Install

Get the latest resource pack from [releases](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.DnnLocalization/releases),
go to DNN &gt; Host &gt; Extensions and install as any other extension. After that, you should see *Russian*
language available to select in Admin &gt; Languages.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute your translations or fixes, it can be done directly via git pull requests, or via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/dnnplatform712/).
